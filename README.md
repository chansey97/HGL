# HGL: A simple graphics library based on X11 or Win32

When I created this repository, the latest version (i.e. HGL-3.2.3.2) on [Hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/HGL) couldn't build and run successfully on Windows with the latest GHC.

Since I haven't found a public repository (e.g. Github) for HGL to create pull requests, I established this repository to fix these compilation and runtime issues.

Successfully tested with HGL-3.2.3.2, GHC-9.6.3, cabal-install 3.10.1.0, Microsoft Windows Vista and later.
